dstat

Simple status gatherer. dstat is based upon dwmstat (released in 2008 by
Jeremy Jay to the public domain)

 - handles libnotify events (using notify.c from dwmstat)
 - gets cpu usage directly from /proc/stats
 - gets memory usage directly from /proc/meminfo
 - gets Clocks directly from
   /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu?/cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq
 - gets wifi signal level directly from /proc/net/wireless
 - gets battery info from /proc/acpi/battery/BAT?
 - gets mpd info directly from socket (WIP, does not work now!)
 - output format for dwm, dwm with colorbar path, dwm-sprinkles and html
   more could be easily added

Configuration is done by editing config.h and config.mk
