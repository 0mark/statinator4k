- Handle calloc fails

- Unify error messages

- Add MPD support

- Add more data modules:
   lm_sensors (at least thermal)

- Maybe add even more:
  uptime, ibm stuff (fan speeds, bluetooth/wifi state, ...), hdd temp, hdd access, ...
  - Maybe more messages:
    irssi, email, ...
  - maybe use smprintf from other project
- Try to swap proc for sys, at last when proc support is deprecated or soon to be deprecated

- QUESTIONS:
 - is it a good idea to use static inline functions as formaters?
 - is it better to free everything thats currently not needed and allocate new when needed?
   current: everythings static
 - is it better to keep file open instead of closing/opening repeatedly?
 - Why is the binary compiled with the new Makefile about a third bigger than with the old one?
   old Makefile:
------------------------
# X11 adds ~200k mem usage (needed for dwm / set root window title)
WITH_X11=-DUSE_X11 -lX11

# MPD Support
WITH_MPD=-DUSE_MPD

# dbus/notify adds ~250k mem usage
WITH_NOTIFY=-DUSE_NOTIFY `pkg-config --cflags --libs dbus-1` notify.c


CC=gcc
CFLAGS= -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Os -s dwmstatus.c -o dwmstatus

all:
	${CC} ${CFLAGS} ${WITH_X11} ${WITH_MPD} ${WITH_NOTIFY}

clean:
	rm dwmstatus
