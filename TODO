- Add more data modules:
   lm_sensors (at least thermal)

- Maybe add even more:
  uptime, ibm stuff (fan speeds, bluetooth/wifi state, ...), hdd temp, hdd access, ...
  - Maybe more messages:
    irssi, email, ...
  - maybe use smprintf from other project

- QUESTIONS:
 - is it a good idea to use static inline functions as formaters?
 - is it better to keep file open instead of closing/opening repeatedly?
