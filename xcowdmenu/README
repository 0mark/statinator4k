cow-notify, fork from dwmstatus ( Jeremy Jay )

Notification daemon that runs on background and executes configured command (If there isn't any executes xcowsay)
Syntax for notifications are "<subject> body"

By default there is no config file, if you want to execute custom command, then create this file : 
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cow-notify/config and type command eg. "xcowsay --image myimage.png"

Issues : 
	* Fails to reply on some python programs (?)
